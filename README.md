The decoder is removed for better speed now. 
-------------------------------------
'processed_2d' is the raw data for training.  
'Transformer_winding_loss3_64dim_encoder' is the training script for the raw data.  
'example4_64dim_log_encoder_c6000' is the example. Run it first to evaluate the performance.  

This is an example of small power litz wire inductor winding loss. The loss is trained from 2D Ansys Maxwell by self-attention neural network.  
For definition and training process. Kindly refer 'Small power litz wire ferrite inductor loss model based on neural network'.
